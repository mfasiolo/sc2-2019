# Statistical Computing 2

This website contains teaching materials for part of the second computing unit of the taught component of the [Computational Statistics and Data Science (COMPASS) PhD programme](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/). The source for this website is available [here](https://github.com/mfasiolo/sc2-2019). The website for the first computing unit can be found [here](https://awllee.github.io/sc1/).

The material provided here focusses on how `R` can be interfaced with `C++` via the `Rcpp` package. More specifically, we guide the students through the following steps:

  1. interfacing `R` with `C++` manually via `.Call()`; 
  
  2. using the `Rcpp` package for easier/safer integration between `R` and `C++`;
  
  3. using `Rcpp sugar` for performing standard statistical operations in `C++`; 
  
  4. performing numerical linear algebra computation via the `RcppArmadillo` package;
  
  5. including `C++` code in an `R` package via `Rcpp`;
  
  6. parallelizing your `C++` code via `RcppParallel`.
  
Some of the chapters contain programming exercises, focussed on exploiting the `Rcpp` family of packages to speed-up statistical computations.
